# gaussdb-query-stream

Receive result rows from [gaussdb](https://github.com/HuaweiCloudDeveloper/gaussdb-node) as a readable (object) stream.

## installation

```bash
$ npm install gaussdb-node --save
$ npm install gaussdb-query-stream --save
```

_requires gaussdb-node>=0.2.1_

## use

```js
const gaussdb = require('gaussdb-node')
const pool = new gaussdb.Pool()
const QueryStream = require('gaussdb-query-stream')
const JSONStream = require('JSONStream')

// pipe 1,000,000 rows to stdout without blowing up your memory usage
pool.connect((err, client, done) => {
  if (err) throw err
  const query = new QueryStream('SELECT * FROM generate_series(0, $1) num', [1000000])
  const stream = client.query(query)
  // release the client when the stream is finished
  stream.on('end', done)
  stream.pipe(JSONStream.stringify()).pipe(process.stdout)
})
```

The stream uses a cursor on the server so it efficiently keeps only a low number of rows in memory.

This is especially useful when doing [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) on a huge table. Using manual `limit` and `offset` queries to fake out async itteration through your data is cumbersome, and _way way way_ slower than using a cursor.


## contribution

I'm very open to contribution! Open a pull request with your code or idea and we'll talk about it. If it's not way insane we'll merge it in too: isn't open source awesome?
